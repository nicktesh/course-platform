# Updates
- (9/21/2021) : Restyled the "Active Courses" for mobile. Now the course titles/category appear beneath the image, and the progress bar shows above the title.
- (8/31/2021) : Fixed a z-index error for mobile nav, as well as the positioning of the mobile header. Started building out the Courses page. Created a searchbar component, and added in "active" courses to continue working on - each course shows a progress bar to show how far you've gone through the course.
- (8/27/2021) : Correct styling has been added as well as SCSS variables. The left side navigation has now been fully styled. I have created custom icons as well as added in the notification bubbles. Also added on the navigation is the user profile area at the bottom. The app is now fully responsive, with a custom mobile nav component and mobile header component added. Fixed some margin and padding issues from the default Bootstrap classes.
- (8/26/2021) : This is the beginning stages of development (Not responsive & Primary Colors have not been set). The React Routes have been properly set up, along with each Switch components that act as pages within the platform. The sidebar navigation has been set up and is linking to each route correctly. The active class has been set up for each active link.
